Psuedocode Solution:

– Create a graph from the variables and equalities where:
    • Each vertex represents a variable
    • If there is an equality x_i = x_j, there is an edge between i and j
– Compute the connected components array
– For each inequality x_i != x_j:
    • If x_i and x_j are in the same connected component, return false
– Return true
