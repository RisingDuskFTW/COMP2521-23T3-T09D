# Important Terminology

- Graph:
  - A collection of vertices (nodes) with a set of edges, each connecting one node to another

- Adjacent:
  - Two nodes are adjacent if and only if there's an edge between them

- Incident:
  - An edge is incident on a node if that node is one of the edge's endpoints

- Degree:
  - The number of edges incident to a node

- Path:
  - Sequence of vertices with each vertex having an edge to its predecessor in the sequence

- Cycle:
  - A path where the last vertex is the same as the first vertex (there is a loop)

- Connected Graph:
  - A graph where there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex

- Complete Graph:
  - A graph where there is an edge from every vertex to every other vertex

- Clique:
  - A complete sugraph

- Directed:
  - Edges in the graph are specifically from one node to another

- Weighted:
  - Edges in the graph have a 'cost'

- Euler Path:
  - A path that traverses each edge in the graph exactly once

- Euler Circuit / Tour:
  - An Euler path that ends where it starts

- Hamiltonian Path:
  - A path that visted every edge in the graph exactly once

- Hamiltonian Circuit / Tour:
  - A Hamiltonian path that ends where it starts

- Outdegree:
  - The number of edges leaving a node in a directed graph

- Indegree:
  - The number of edges entering a node in a directed graph

- Reachable:
  - A node v2 is reachable from v1 if there is a path from v1 to v2

## Less Important Terminology

- Disjoint Graph:
  - A graph that is not connected

- Tree:
  - A connected graph with no cycles

- Acylic Graph:
  - A graph that has no cycles
